This project implements a (lightwight) Vision Transformer-based model to classify mammogram images.

During a breast cancer screening exam, four mammograms are usually generated. 
For each breast, two views are acquired, Craniocaudal (CC) and Mediolateral Oblique (MLO). 
The ViT-mammography package is a classication model which separaties the CC and the MLO views.
